# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — 2026-03-21

### Known Issue: Kiro CLI 1.28.0

Kiro CLI 1.28.0 had two bugs that broke subagent pipelines:
1. **Shell approval blocking** ([#4751](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/4751)) — subagents triggered interactive approval on every `shell` call
2. **Subagent result return failure** ([#6163](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/6163)) — subagents completed work but the orchestrator never received the result

Both bugs are fixed in **Kiro CLI 1.28.1**. If you're on 1.28.0, upgrade: `curl -fsSL https://cli.kiro.dev/install | bash`. Kiro CLI 1.24–1.27 and 1.28.1+ all work correctly.

### Added

- Absolute paths for all `references/` file citations in 5 subagent SKILL.md files (reduces path ambiguity when subagents read reference documents)
- `glob` pattern hint in `cf-cdn-dns-parser` Step 1 for DNS.txt discovery
- Orchestrator `references/` directory (`waf-pipeline.md`, `cdn-pipeline.md`) added to repo and install script
- Lambda@Edge replica deletion troubleshooting entry in `docs/troubleshooting.md` and `docs/troubleshooting_CN.md`

### Changed

- `install.sh` now copies orchestrator `references/` directory; warns if Kiro CLI 1.28.0 detected
- Reordered Lambda@Edge troubleshooting entries: "destroy" issue now appears before "apply" issue

### Fixed

- Relative `references/` paths in SKILL.md files could cause subagents to spend extra tool calls discovering file locations
